**Project Objective**
- Build a human–AI annotation platform to detect weapon systems in overhead and drone imagery by:
- Curating a weapons‑focused dataset (tanks, artillery, jets, launchers)
- Auto‑labeling with YOLOv8 and allowing human approval/refinement
- Recording AI vs. human corrections and confidence levels
- Delivering a sleek Streamlit/Gradio UI with audit‑ready logs
