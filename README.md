**Project Objective**
- Build a human–AI annotation platform to detect weapon systems in overhead and drone imagery by:
- Curating a weapons‑focused dataset (tanks, artillery, jets, launchers)
- Auto‑labeling with YOLOv8 and allowing human approval/refinement
- Recording AI vs. human corrections and confidence levels
- Delivering a sleek Streamlit/Gradio UI with audit‑ready logs

**Dataset Download Information**

XView
xView is a large satellite imagery dataset that could be used for object detection in overhead scenes. It contains over 1 million labeled objects across 60 classes, including vehicles, buildings and infrastructure. The high-resolution RGB images make it useful for analyzing real-world environments.
